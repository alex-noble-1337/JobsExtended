<loadingscreentip>You will not get paid for delivering cargo if any of the cargo goes missing or gets damaged during the transport.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Generating more power than the devices in the submarine are consuming may damage junction boxes or cause fires.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Junction boxes and other electrical devices may get damaged if they stay submerged too long.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Letting the submarine's nuclear reactor overheat may cause fires. If an overheated reactor is not shut down, it will eventually lead to a nuclear meltdown.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Most submarines are equipped with stationary batteries that can be used as a temporary source of backup power in the case of a reactor failure.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Railgun shells and depth charges include a compartment that can hold additional explosives.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Passive sonar can be used to detect nearby sound sources without attracting unwanted attention. You can also get a rough idea of your surroundings based on the sounds reflected from the ice walls.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>There are many ways to get past locked doors, including forcing them open with a crowbar or rewiring them to a button you have access to.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Stationary batteries are equipped with docks that can be used to charge battery cells.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Oxygen generators are equipped with docks that can be used to refill oxygen tanks.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Supercapacitors can deliver large bursts of power, but cannot store as much energy as batteries. They are often used to power railguns and other devices that require brief bursts of high current.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Nuclear reactors are equipped with an automatic control system that adjusts the power output to a suitable level when enabled. However, the system is not always fast enough to react to large fluctuations in power consumption.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The sonar imaging on the navigation terminal may become inaccurate if the terminal is damaged—make sure your engineers keep the terminal in a good condition!</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>When deploying a decoy, be sure to deactivate your active sonar for best results.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Attempting to rewire powered devices without adequate electrical engineering skills may get you electrocuted.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Welding tools are simple enough to be used by any submariner, but trained mechanics are generally faster welders and have a lower risk of injuring themselves with the tool.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>All submariners have been trained to do basic repairs on electrical devices, but electrical engineers get the job done much faster.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>All submariners have been trained to do basic repairs on mechanical devices, but mechanics get the job done much faster.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Captains are generally much more adept at maneuvering the submarine than the average sailor.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>If the reactor on a sub is not able to produce sufficient power to run all onboard systems, try reducing the charge rate for the onboard batteries and supercapacitors, or regulate the times when the sub is running at full speed.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The electrical and mechanical systems on a sub will gradually degrade due to the harsh conditions and constant wear and tear. Be sure to have mechanics and engineers perform maintenance from time to time in order to avoid breakdowns at inopportune moments.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Breaking down alien artifacts in a deconstructor may provide you with exotic raw materials.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Some of the alien structures on Europa have been constructed of a metamaterial that's outstandingly resistant to physical damage, and as such has become an important subject of research to Europan scientists.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Special caution must be taken when bringing alien artifacts on board the submarine.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Very little is known of the presumably extinct alien civilization that built the ruins scattered all across Europa. The age of the ruins is also a mystery, since the self-repairing properties of the structures and devices make chronological dating methods wildly inaccurate.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>No remains of the alien lifeforms that built the ruins scattered all across Europa have ever been discovered. The only life encountered inside the structures are the biomechanical entities that maintain and guard them.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>While exploring ruins or caves, drop flares as often as possible to help mark a path out, should you need to make a hasty exit for some reason.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Cannibalistic behavior is very common among crawlers. Killing one in a swarm may distract the rest as they enter into a feeding frenzy.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Mudraptors can easily tear their way through metal doors with their sharp beaks.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The so-called husk parasites slowly take over and consume the body of their host, eventually turning them into nothing but an empty exoskeleton controlled by the parasite.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Many creatures on Europa are protected by a strong shell, and are difficult to damage with conventional weapons, though there may be weak points in their armor.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Loud devices and sonar pings may alert nearby creatures.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Performing CPR without adequate medical skills may cause internal damage to the patient.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Opiates such as morphine and fentanyl are an effective way of treating injuries in an emergency, but regular use may eventually lead to a state of addiction and cause dangerous withdrawal symptoms.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Bleeding wounds can be treated with bandages and hemostatic agents. The patient may also need saline or blood packs to replace the lost blood.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Mental disorders such as psychosis are unfortunately common among submarine crews, particularly after ruin expeditions. If your crewmates start seeing or hearing things others don't see or hear, report it to a medical doctor immediately.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The medical doctors' main task is to keep the crew in a good shape, but a medic with a syringe gun and a bit of knowhow on poisons can also be very useful in fending off intruders.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Many drugs may have unintended side effects. Keep an eye on the patient and be ready to administer additional medications to counteract these side effects if necessary.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>When using a diving mask, be careful not to mix up welding fuel tanks and oxygen tanks.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Diving masks let you breathe underwater, but don't offer any protection against the bone-crushing pressure outside the submarine. If there's a major hull breach, find a diving suit immediately.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>In the event of a fire, burns are not the only thing to watch out for—fires can quickly consume all the oxygen inside the submarine.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Traversing the so-called Hydrothermal Wastes requires special caution. Not only are they abundant in wildlife, but the water currents caused by geothermal activity make navigation even more hazardous.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Some of the sessile lifeforms in Europa emit low-frequency sounds that may disrupt the submarine's sonar.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Europa is rich in natural resources, and an enterprising captain with a sharp eye and a plasma cutter may stand to make a tidy profit.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>You can disguise yourself as someone else by wearing their ID card and something that covers your face.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>It's possible to build voice-controlled systems by linking wifi components to the radio chat in the submarine editor.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The radiation belts around Jupiter make it impracticable to establish permanent settlements above Europa's surface, and as such almost all Europan outposts are located below its icy crust.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The dynamics of Europa's underwater ecosystem are still not fully understood, but it is believed that the base of the food chain is mostly formed by chemosynthetic bacteria.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The Europa Coalition started off as a trade and cooperation agreement between the two largest Europan settlements and a handful of private paramilitary groups, but gradually grew to become what is essentially the Europan government.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The much-ridiculed initiative to help submariners cope in a high-stress environment by including professional entertainers in the crews was promptly deemed a failure and discontinued.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Most vessels avoid venturing outside the tunnels and cracks within Europa's icy crust—the vast, empty Abyss between the surface layers and the rocky interior hosts many of Europa's largest and most dangerous inhabitants.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>If left undisturbed for several years, a colony of ballast flora can eventually grow into a Thalamus, an intelligent organism capable of exerting some degree of control over the systems of the submarine it's inhabiting.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>You can give context-sensitive commands when the cursor is over a usable object by holding down shift and opening the command interface.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Making trouble at an outpost hurts your reputation. A bad reputation might cause the inhabitants of the outpost to charge you a premium for their services, or, in more extreme cases, lead to a confrontation with their security.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Many Europan outposts don't recognize the Coalition's authority, although it is still powerful enough that few dare to openly oppose it. However, there are groups such as the Jovian Separatists who do fight against it, aiming to bring it down and create a more democratic society.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Behold the Watcher. Don't lose your mind.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Straddling the border between surface ice and the denser, rockier subsurface ice layer, the Europan Ridge is the area along the western-most slope of the Eye of Europa. Warmer water is convected into this area, allowing a wider array of life to subsist.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The Aphotic Plateau sits atop the western rim of an ancient impact crater known as the Eye of Europa. As with the neighboring Europan Ridge, the Plateau’s tunnel networks consist mostly of dark, rocky ice pressed as hard as any stone by the unimaginable weight of the ice above it.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Most of the human habitation on Europa is situated in the so-called Cold Caverns. Due to the cold water and relative proximity to the surface, this biome is biologically less diverse than others, primarily hosting moderate concentrations of crawlers and practically no vegetation.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Ice spires are enormous icy projections that sometimes burst through the subsurface tunnels under Europa's crust. Submarine crews are advised to avoid any contact with the spires, or to destroy any they come across, as the sharp edges can easily tear through a submarine's hull.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>The poorly understood "Piezo Crystals" found in The Great Sea pose some extra challenges to crews travelling through the region: Navigating too close to one may cause disruptions in the submarine's electrical grid.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Administering drugs without sufficient medical knowledge may reduce the quality of the effects of the drug.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Be careful not to dive too deep. Most submarine hulls will start collapsing at the depth of a few thousand meters, so if you're planning on traversing the deeper biomes or the Abyss, you may need to purchase reinforcements to the hull or a special Deep Diver submarine.</loadingscreentip>
<loadingscreentip>Watchers are docile but inquisitive creatures: despite having no desire to attack submarines, they frequently approach ships to gaze at human activities.</loadingscreentip>

<adjustedlightsnotification>The brightness of the lights has been adjusted. Areas with multiple light sources may still appear too bright and require reducing the range or brightness of the lights manually. You may also use the console command 'multiplylights' to adjust the brightness of all the lights as once. For example, 'multiplylights 1,1,1,0.5' would decrease the brightness by 50%.</adjustedlightsnotification>

<subeditor.shadowcastinglightswarning>The submarine includes a very high number of shadow-casting lights, which can cause performance issues. You may want to go through the light sources and disable shadow casting where possible: dim and/or low-range static lights don't necessarily need to cast shadows if letting the light go through walls and doors is not noticeable, and lights outside the submarine can be set to be drawn behind the submarine so shadows don't need to be cast.</subeditor.shadowcastinglightswarning>

<campaignstart>In the late 20th century, it was discovered that under the icy, irradiated surface of Jupiter's moon Europa lies a vast sea capable of sustaining life. This discovery sent shockwaves through the scientific community.\n\nIn the year 2022, the first manned space flight arrived on Europa to discover that the moon was indeed already sustaining life, in the form of hostile sub-aquatic fauna. Besides the wildlife, the researchers faced gruelling difficulties posed by the dangerous radiation emitted from Jupiter and the intense cold and tremendous pressure of the Europan ocean.\n\nDespite all their hardships, Earth-born colonists were able to construct a handful of habitable outposts where a new way of life developed over many decades. A new system of governance was formed by a coalition of the largest, most influential cities on the moon. Different industries made their mark in the new world, including mining, manufacturing and chemical laboratories.\n\nOver the years, Europan society became more and more dissociated from Earth. Fifty years ago, contact was lost entirely, and no more supply ships have arrived since.\n\nSub-aquatic travel and vehicles are in a key role in this new society, scouting for new inhabitable locations, protecting citizens from creature attacks and establishing supply lines between stations as humanity ventures ever deeper to evade the lethal radiation from Jupiter above. The life of a crewmember aboard one of these submarines is a lucrative one, albeit dangerous and often short.\n\nYou have enlisted to serve on a yyyy-class submarine, docked at xxxx. The waters of Europa open up before you—explore, help expand the colonies, and make of this place what you will.</campaignstart>

<!-- Submarine names & descriptions -->
<submarine.name.humpback>Humpback</submarine.name.humpback>
<submarine.description.humpback>A former military vessel, WH4-L3 'Humpback' has been outfitted to withstand most of the dangers in deep Europa. Her relatively high velocity is offset by low maneuverability. As she's still boasting an older model reactor, power needs to be supplemented by a backup battery array or the crew will find themselves unable to run all of the new equipment.</submarine.description.humpback>
<submarine.name.bunyip>Bunyip</submarine.name.bunyip>
<submarine.description.bunyip>Latest in the line of personnel transports, Bunyip is capable of ferrying crew between submarines and installations. Its operating radius is considerably lower than its more advanced cousins and no weapons on board makes it vulnerable to attacks.</submarine.description.bunyip>
<submarine.name.muikku>Muikku</submarine.name.muikku>
<submarine.description.muikku>The workhorse of the colonies, these little shuttles have good speed and dive/ascent characteristics, but they are fragile and their low-capacity batteries limit their range somewhat.</submarine.description.muikku>
<submarine.name.orca>Orca</submarine.name.orca>
<submarine.description.orca>With a relatively high top speed and fantastic ascent and descent characteristics due to her 3 large ballast tanks, Orca class subs are agile vessels, let down only by their small compliment of weapons, unreliable engine and reactors with a greater than average hunger for fuel.</submarine.description.orca>
<submarine.name.remora>Remora</submarine.name.remora>
<submarine.description.remora>A range of customization options are available for Remora. In this model, some of the main hull space has been replaced by a detachable ballast and a remote-controlled drone. A large crew is needed to operate this submarine.</submarine.description.remora>
<submarine.name.typhon>Typhon</submarine.name.typhon>
<submarine.description.typhon>Typhon class subs are known for their brutish appearance, reasonable array of light and heavy firepower, and their general dependability. Any captain should be aware of their poor rate of descent and unimpressive top speed.</submarine.description.typhon>
<submarine.name.dugong>Dugong</submarine.name.dugong>
<submarine.description.dugong>Compared to larger vessels, the Dugong series is overshadowed in all aspects except one: their reliability for their price is world class. They're lacking in firepower and speed, so smart maneuvering is key.</submarine.description.dugong>
<submarine.name.selkie>Selkie</submarine.name.selkie>
<submarine.description.selkie>The workhorse of the colonies, these little shuttles have good speed and dive/ascent characteristics, but they are fragile and their low-capacity batteries limit their range somewhat.</submarine.description.selkie>
<submarine.name.venture>Venture</submarine.name.venture>
<submarine.description.venture>Originally intended as research vessels, Venture shuttles have been co-opted as a more robust alternative for travel between outposts and submarines.</submarine.description.venture>
<submarine.name.berilia>Berilia</submarine.name.berilia>
<submarine.description.berilia>Berilia is one of the biggest cargo ships on Europa. Its two engines and three ballasts require a copious amount of power to operate, and keeping the machinery in good working condition is a handful for even a moderately large crew.</submarine.description.berilia>
<submarine.name.kastrull>Kastrull</submarine.name.kastrull>
<submarine.description.kastrull>The Kastrull is a dependable attack sub class bringing plenty of firepower to any fight, and although it's not very nimble, it does sport a drone gunship as standard. Keep in mind that with its experimental open ballast tanks, low tolerance to flooding and numerous crew stations, a large, experienced crew will get the most out of this sub.</submarine.description.kastrull>
<submarine.name.hemulen>Hemulen</submarine.name.hemulen>
<submarine.description.hemulen>For when you need extra room to stretch your legs or want some space between you and the poor, choose Hemulen shuttles.</submarine.description.hemulen>
<submarine.name.typhon2>Typhon 2</submarine.name.typhon2>
<submarine.description.typhon2>Typhon 2 is an overhauled version of the venerable Typhon class of sub. Serving as a heavy gunship, the Typhon 2 class subs remain slow and ugly, but with the benefit of better survivability for their crews.</submarine.description.typhon2>
<submarine.name.azimuth>Azimuth</submarine.name.azimuth>
<submarine.description.azimuth>Superior speed, sleek design and quality-of-life systems make this submarine a favorite among wealthy Coalition captains who manage to make it to retirement.</submarine.description.azimuth>
<submarine.name.r-29>R-29 "Big Rig"</submarine.name.r-29>
<submarine.description.r-29>R-29 is a heavyweight transport ship. While not terribly well armed against Europa's underwater denizens, it has been retrofitted with two powerful electric discharge coils. Original design by rav2n.</submarine.description.r-29>

<terminalwelcomemsg.kastrulldiary1>\nDay 1 of the expedition out of Meltwater. We're navigating through a newly discovered gap in the ice, trying to find a shorter route to Novaya Moskva.\n\nIt's not the safest of missions, but hopefully it'll be my last. Should be able to retire after this one.\n\nDay 3. Cap says the whole voyage shouldn't take more than six days. By my reckoning that should place us somewhere around halfway there.\n\nCourse there's always a chance this cave doesn't actually have an exit and we'll have to turn back.\n\nDay 4. Now if I were a superstitious man, I'd wager that saying the worst outcome in any given situation out loud makes it come true. Turns out this route is a dead end.\n\nCaptain is bummed out. I share his disappointment. It'll take a few days longer to get to an outpost now that we have to go back.\n\nDay 8. There was a hole in the ice here. It's gone now. Icebergs must've moved and closed it. We've started broadcasting our position in hopes that someone picks it up. They're joking now, asking me why I chose my last expedition to get lost at sea.\n\nDay 9. We're rationing food and water. Crew is getting ornery.\n\nDay 11? 12? No response. Food's running out. More concerned about water, myself. Don't feel like writing any more.\n\nDay 30-ish, who cares anymore? I'm surrounded by dead men. Pale husks of men slumped on the floor. Some of their eyes still move, but they're dead nonetheless.\n</terminalwelcomemsg.kastrulldiary1>
<terminalwelcomemsg.dugongtransmission>Replaying last outgoing transmissions.\n[2451-3-4 11:33] DG-35 calling for Tara colony. Do you read?\n[2451-3-4 11:35] Tara colony, do you read? We're taking heavy hits to our topside!\n[2451-3-4 11:35] Look at the size of that thing!\n[2451-3-4 12:02] We managed to take down the attacker, but the hull is heavily damaged. Requesting rescue from anyone who receives this call.\n[2451-3-4 12:06] Hello?\n</terminalwelcomemsg.dugongtransmission>
<terminalwelcomemsg.traitorletter>This message will be both my farewell and confession. I was tasked to smuggle this sonar beacon on board and turn it on when we were a safe distance away. It turns out it was set to a frequency that attracts monsters. I was promised a shuttle was picking me up when the task was done but they never showed.\n\nThis is the last time I accept a "research assignment" from a big-shoe. Or anyone, for that matter. May they honk in hell.</terminalwelcomemsg.traitorletter>

<tutorial.mechanictitle>Mechanic - Glue, duct tape and your nerve are the only things keeping the crew alive.</tutorial.mechanictitle>
<tutorial.mechanicdescription>When the plan goes as planned and the gear works is as probable as the human race leaving this shithole. There are no breaks or rest for you, as everything that can break down, will break down. And if nothing’s broken, then it's maintenance, maintenance, maintenance. Getting to the next destination is all that matters, and you’re the one who delivers. There’s no thank-yous or respect, just snickering and contempt from your "fellow crew members"—but that’s okay. This is YOUR survival vessel, and if any of them make it too, well...whoop dee doo for them.</tutorial.mechanicdescription>
<tutorial.mechanicresponsibilities>Responsibilities\n-Maintenance of machinery\n-Repairing leaks</tutorial.mechanicresponsibilities>
<tutorial.engineertitle>Engineer - The one who harnesses the power of nature.</tutorial.engineertitle>
<tutorial.engineerdescription>Power and oxygen, it's like that. Without, the ship don’t move and the lungs won’t breathe. Beyond the fancy talk and costume play, you are the guy who really runs the ship, get it? Trust in the laws of physics and think clear. Also, keep your eye on that damn toy-tinkering wannabe engineer mechanic, and whatever you do, don’t bite into the psycho-babble of the medic. He’s so deep in his softie inner world he’s practically a woman. Captain and security are harmless, and way below your intelligence. Obviously.</tutorial.engineerdescription>
<tutorial.engineerresponsibilities>Responsibilities\n-Electrical item maintenance\n-Operating the reactor</tutorial.engineerresponsibilities>
<tutorial.securityofficertitle>Security Officer - The backbone of violence.</tutorial.securityofficertitle>
<tutorial.securityofficerdescription>It is said that pressure brings out the worst in people. Not everybody has your moral strength—hell, most of them are so crooked that it’s questionable if they even should be allowed to live. Channel the crew’s anger toward the creatures outside, but never fool yourself into trusting them. Keep the nukes ready, the handcuffs available, and every now and then put someone in the brig just so they know who’s in charge!</tutorial.securityofficerdescription>
<tutorial.securityofficerresponsibilities>Responsibilities\n-Keeping the order\n-Repelling intruders</tutorial.securityofficerresponsibilities>
<tutorial.medicaldoctortitle>Medical Doctor - Maintaining the key resource: the people</tutorial.medicaldoctortitle>
<tutorial.medicaldoctordescription>Guns and engines and reactors don't keep the ship running—people do. It’s up to you to keep the gunner alive to man the guns and captain alive to steer the ship. And remember, your job goes well beyond the physical. We live crammed into tight spaces, under ice, in the sea. When the lights go out and your "buddies" go to sleep, all kinds of dark shit crawls into their minds. Keep them alive and sane, or put them down like dogs. It’s up to you.</tutorial.medicaldoctordescription>

<tutorial.captaintitle>Captain - Naval visionary, seafarer, a genius. Possibly.</tutorial.captaintitle>
<tutorial.captaindescription>Captain Ahab once said, "Hell is an idea first born on an undigested apple-dumpling." Do you know what that means? No. Does the crew think you are a mysterious genius? Hell yeah. This job is at least as much appearing to know what to do as actually knowing what to do. You are the map and the compass, the guy with the big picture. Navigate and make the tough calls. And remember, you’re just a few steps away from being the mayor of an outpost, and if a couple fellows need to die for that—so be it!</tutorial.captaindescription>

<!-- Tutorial extras -->
<tutorial.airlocktitle>Airlock</tutorial.airlocktitle>
<tutorial.airlockdescription>Every submarine should be equipped with a secure airlock where the crew can exit the sub safely and without too much flooding.\n\nTo safely exit the submarine, equip a diving suit and other necessary items (usually a handheld sonar, weapons and extra oxygen tank or two). Then make your way to the airlock. Be sure to close all the doors behind you to stop the water’s flow before too much of it gets inside.\n\nWhen coming back inside, use water pumps to drain all of the water before going deeper into the submarine. It is also helpful to return all of the equipment back to their proper places and refill used oxygen tanks at the oxygen generator.</tutorial.airlockdescription>
<tutorial.railguntitle>Railgun</tutorial.railguntitle>
<tutorial.railgundescription>The railgun works like a coil gun, except it fires big shells that can be upgraded with explosives.\n\nRailgun loaders are loaded with single railgun shells instead of boxes of ammunition. Otherwise, operating them is the same: interact with the periscope to aim with the turret, then press {0} to fire. Press {1} to stop aiming.</tutorial.railgundescription>
<tutorial.syringeguntitle>Syringe gun</tutorial.syringeguntitle>
<tutorial.syringegundescription>A ranged weapon of choice for medics, the syringe gun uses medicine as ammunition. This allows for administering cures from afar. Be aware: medicines fired from long range are less effective than those used in the medical interface.\n\nA tactical choice in combat would be to load the syringe gun with poison and fire it at enemies. Aim the syringe gun the same way you would other long-range weapons: {0} to aim, {1} to fire.</tutorial.syringegundescription>
<tutorial.plasmacuttertitle>Plasma cutter</tutorial.plasmacuttertitle>
<tutorial.plasmacutterdescription>The plasma cutter is a device used to cut through walls and doors. It functions like the welding tool: {0} to aim, {1} to fire.\n\nWhile the plasma cutter is primarily a tool, it does inflict burns on anyone who gets in the way, which makes it a handy makeshift weapon.</tutorial.plasmacutterdescription>
<tutorial.crowbartitle>Crowbar</tutorial.crowbartitle>
<tutorial.crowbardescription>A heavy instrument that can be used to force open doors. Handy when someone has been tampering with door wiring or when you need to get to rooms you’re not allowed in. Use ({0}) the crowbar on a closed door to start prying it open. The crowbar must be equipped to do this.</tutorial.crowbardescription>
<tutorial.mineralstitle>Minerals</tutorial.mineralstitle>
<tutorial.mineralsdescription>The basic materials for crafting can be bought, deconstructed or found in the world.\n\nMinerals are spawned in the cave and ice walls, and they can be cut out using the plasma cutter and then picked up. Raw minerals can be deconstructed to create craftable elements.</tutorial.mineralsdescription>
<tutorial.psychosistitle>Psychosis</tutorial.psychosistitle>
<tutorial.psychosisdescription>When in contact with certain performance-enhancing drugs or under some extraterrestrial influence, players may be afflicted with psychosis, causing them to experience visual and auditory hallucinations and phantom pains.\n\nPsychosis may be cured using haloperidol.</tutorial.psychosisdescription>
<tutorial.opiatestitle>Opiate addiction and withdrawals</tutorial.opiatestitle>
<tutorial.opiatesdescription>Overuse of pain medication causes addiction and, in time, withdrawal. Withdrawal symptoms can be reduced by feeding the addiction, but to truly be rid of the effects, one must either stop taking the drugs entirely or use naloxone.</tutorial.opiatesdescription>
<tutorial.oxygentitle>Oxygen</tutorial.oxygentitle>
<tutorial.oxygendescription>Oxygen is a valuable commodity in underwater Europa. It must be readily available during long transits aboard submarines, which is made possible by oxygen generators. They pump air through ventilation to different rooms and can be used to refill oxygen tanks.\n\nTo refill oxygen tanks, interact ([InteractType.Use]) with the generator to open its inventory. Insert an empty oxygen tank into one of the slots to start refilling it. When the tank is full, drag it back to your inventory or into your diving suit/mask.</tutorial.oxygendescription>
<tutorial.laddertitle>Ladders</tutorial.laddertitle>
<tutorial.ladderdescription>To grab onto a ladder, press {0}. Use {1} and {2} buttons to climb the ladder. Let go of the ladder by pressing {3} again.</tutorial.ladderdescription>

<engineer.powerupreactor>Reactor</engineer.powerupreactor>
<engineer.powerupreactorobjective>Power up submarine’s reactor</engineer.powerupreactorobjective>
<engineer.powerupreactortext>Nuclear reactors provide power to submarines and outposts. They require fuel to create heat and a crew member to regulate the output.\n\nDrag a fuel rod to the item slot on the left side. Multiple fuel rods create more heat, but in normal circumstances one is enough and any more might cause the reactor to overheat.\n\nStart by setting the fission rate so that the needle is on green, then do the same for turbine output. You can see load and output values to the right. Try to keep the output as close to load as possible; a lower output can lead to power outages, and higher to overvoltage and fires.\n\nWhen the reactor operator leaves the interface, consider turning on automatic control. With automatic control, the reactor responds to any fluctuations in grid load, but it is considerably slower than a human operator.</engineer.powerupreactortext>

One of them walks straight up to the box, picks it up and stares at you, then at your hand. You realize you’re still holding a bike horn in your hand.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1>Apologize and put the horn back in the box.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1.c1>The jester turns around stoically and continues on with the group, leaving you to scratch your head.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o2>Honk the horn.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o2.c1>You raise the horn to your eye level and squeeze it. Instantly, chaos erupts among the group of clowns. They applaud, prance around and giggle uncontrollably, as if the sound of the horn were the funniest thing imaginable. One of them ruffles your hair approvingly.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations1.o2>Better not.</eventtext.clownrelations1.o2>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.c1>A clown is loitering nearby. When he sees you approach, he perks up and tries to get your attention.</eventtext.clownrelations2.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o1>See what he has to say.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o1>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.c1>The jester reaches out to you. In a similar motion, you raise your own arm and simultaneously you both honk each other’s noses. Twice, as is tradition when meeting a new brother. Without saying a word, he reaches into his pack and hands you a brand new bike horn. He salutes you and leaves, his footsteps squeaking rhythmically.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.c2>Before you can react, the loathsome harlequin reaches out and painfully honks your nose.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.c2>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.o1>Truly, they are a scourge on Europa.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.clownrelations2.o2>Avoid eye contact.</eventtext.clownrelations2.o2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.c1>You come across an unconscious worker. There are no signs of violence and nobody else is around.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1>Diagnose.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.c1>The patient’s lips are blue, their breaths are short and shallow and their heart is beating very slowly. Telltale signs of Fentanyl overdose. Injection marks on their arm confirm your diagnosis.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1>Treat the overdose with Naloxone.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1.c1>You treat the overdose with Naloxone. The patient is still unconscious, but their condition is stable.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1.c2>You have no Naloxone. All you can do at this point is make sure the patient's life is not in immediate danger and alert the local officials.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2>Give them basic first aid and alert the outpost doctor.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2.c1>You make sure the patient is stable and decide to let the local officials deal with the rest.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2.o1>Good job.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.c2>Well, he's unconscious all right. Probably just sleeping off a hangover or something.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.c2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o3>Eh, that's the best I can do for now.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o1.o3>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o2>Check their pockets.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o2>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o2.c1>You find some spare change in their pocket, but a passerby catches you in the act. It seems looting injured people is frowned upon here.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o2.c1>
<eventtext.goodsamaritan.o3>Step over their body and continue on.</eventtext.goodsamaritan.o3>
<eventtext.propaganda.c1>A row of posters line the wall. It looks like the outpost directorial election is coming up. A gallery of stern-looking people are observing the hallway, conveniently grouped according to their political affiliation.</eventtext.propaganda.c1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1>Inspect the posters.</eventtext.propaganda.o1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.c1>Some of the Coalition Party’s boards have fallen victim to vandalism. “Bring power back to the hands of the people!” and “Down with the oligarchy!” are some of the catchphrases spray-painted on candidates’ faces. Separatists up to their usual tricks.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.c1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1>Add some of your own flair too.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1.c1>You draw some vulgar art of your own, then quickly move on before the fascists catch you in the act.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1.o1>That'll show them.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.propaganda.o1.o2>Keep walking.</eventtext.propaganda.o1.o2>
<eventtext.propaganda.o2>Not interested in outpost politics.</eventtext.propaganda.o2>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.c1>As you’re walking down the hallway, you catch a whiff of something sweet.</eventtext.goblincooking1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1>“Who’s cooking?”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.c1>You sniff around and find the aroma coming from a nearby vent. Suddenly you feel very hungry.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1>Try to find the source.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.c1>You peer into the dark vent, trying to find out where it leads. No avail—the vents here are all connected. Even if you were to, say, climb in and follow the smell, you’d stand no chance of finding the sau–, er…source.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1>“Climb in the vent? Good idea!”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.c1>It takes you no effort to remove the vent cover and wriggle inside. The smell is now intoxicating and it seems to come from every direction. Desperate, you start crawling. Eventually the vent splits into two paths. Something clicks in your head. This isn’t right.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“I’ve come this far. Might as well keep going.”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You pick a direction and crawl on. Suddenly it doesn’t smell so good anymore. The aroma has gradually turned into a sickly sweet, rotten stink. You start panicking as the tight walls begin closing in. Your vision blurs and everything goes dark. The last thing you see is a vaguely humanoid shape squirming toward your helpless body.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Goodbye.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The next thing you know, you wake up outside the vent. Strangely, the vent is screwed shut and there are no signs of anyone having entered it. A quick inspection reveals you're uninjured, but your pockets are empty of change.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2>Turn back.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>With great effort, you manage to turn around and make your way back to where you entered. While unhurt, you have a feeling you brought back something with you from the vents.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>“At least it's over now.”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2>“What a fool I would be if I climbed in there…”</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2.c1>You chuckle at the idea of climbing into an air vent in a strange outpost in search of food. Even so, it takes some effort to leave the vent and the alluring aroma within.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2.o1>Now to get back to business.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o2>Ignore the siren call of the scent.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.goblincooking1.o2>Ignore the aroma.</eventtext.goblincooking1.o2>
<eventtext.outbreak.c1>You overhear someone nearby talking to a radio. “Yeah, I gave them the eggs. Uh huh… Yeah. I made sure they swallowed ‘em. ...I don’t know, maybe three minutes ago?” That’s weird, you think to yourself. Hopefully nothing weird comes out of this.</eventtext.outbreak.c1>
<eventtext.outbreak.o1>OK.</eventtext.outbreak.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.c1>Someone has set up shop in their dorm room. A sign on the door says “Mike the Scryer: He’ll divine answers to all your questions!”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1>Step inside.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.c1>You peek inside. Heavy curtains line the walls that are otherwise full of crudely drawn pictures of monsters, expensive submarines and well-endowed women. In the middle of the room is a round table with a couple of empty bottles of Europan moonshine and a crystal ball. A man wearing thick glasses and a sloppily tied turban is sitting behind the table. He squints and motions you to take a seat. “I’m Mike,” he croaks. “5 marks to ask me anything.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1>Pay him.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.c1>You sit down at the table opposite Mike. A pungent smell of alcohol wafts from him. “Come on, then. What d’you wanna know about?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1>“What’s the meaning of life?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.c1>Mike conjures up a bottle of booze. “Real original.” He takes a swig. “There are a few schools of thought, but basically it boils down to this: Either you make life good for yourself or do good by others.” He reaches over the table to offer you a drink and knocks down a few bottles in the process. They shatter on the floor. “Shit.” Mike slumps down dejectedly. “There’s no God,” he mutters as he pushes himself up and starts for the cleaning closet. “Session’s over.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.o1>All right.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2>“What do you reckon is in the center of Europa?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.c1>Mike blinks. “What? I don’t know. Lava? Or is it magma in this case?” He turns toward a bunk. “Hey Jimmy! Is it lava if it’s underground or magma?” A bundle of sheets stirs a bit. “What is–? Fuck off Mike, I’m sleeping,” it mumbles back. Mike scratches the back of his head. “It’s gotta be one or the other. What else could it be?” He chuckles and flashes his rotting teeth. “A gateway to Earth? Ridiculous.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.o1>Yeah, I guess it is.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3>“What’s up with the clowns?”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.c1>“Funny little fuckers, aren’t they?” Mike leans back in his chair. It squeaks in protest. “The legend has it that a cargo ship carrying entertainment supplies wrecked somewhere near Uusi-Turcu. They recovered a single survivor weeks later. She was wearing a striped shirt, rubber mask and gibbering something about a “Honkmother” who had kept her company.” He picks his nose and pensively inspects his findings. “Ever since, there’s been a group of ‘em what worships the Honkmother.” “Really?” you ask, enthralled. He flicks the booger off. “No. But that’s all I got.”</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.o1>...I want my money back.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o1.o3.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o2>Back out.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot1.o2>Ignore all charlatans.</eventtext.miketheidiot1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.c1>You run into a familiar face. It seems Mike the fortune teller has found his way here. This time he’s wearing a janitor’s overalls and is in the process of mopping up a puddle of what seems like someone’s former breakfast.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1>“Moving up in the world, eh?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.c1>“Oh, hey. Yeah, I figured it was time to bounce after the... You know, the incident. With the reactor.” You decide not to delve deeper. “I still have plenty of wisdom to dispense. 5 marks or a pack of cigarettes.”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1>Pay up.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.c1>He leans on his mop. “So what can I help you with?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1>“How’s Earth?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.c1>Mike takes out a cigarette and puts it in his mouth. “Guess it’s still out there. A bit worse for wear though, am I right?” He flashes a toothless smile and fishes out a lighter from his pocket. “I had a pen pal there a few years back, you know? A real prolific writer. No wonder, you ought to get a lot of writing done with twelve fingers.” He lights the cigarette, takes a drag and coughs his lungs out. “Fuck me!” He exclaims after the fit subsides. “People really smoke these things?” He tosses the whole pack in the trash. “Not for me.”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.o1>Good to know.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2>“What happened to Mantises?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.c1>“Oh, them? Natural selection. Some things are just better suited for survival.” He rolls up his sleeve, revealing a crude tattoo that states: “I fuck with boots on.” He continues: “Tougher. Faster. Prettier. Only the strong come out on top.” A passerby tosses a soda can on the floor and Mike bends to pick it up. “Apex predators, that’s what we are,” he declares as he places the can in the trash.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.o1>Truth.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3>“Why would someone shoot a man before throwing him out of an airlock?”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.c1>“It’s all part of the plan,” Mike muses. “Sending a message. You gotta assert dominance, otherwise you get no respect.” He gets back to mopping the puke off of the floor. “It’s how you survive on a submarine, same as in prison.” “You were incarcerated?” you ask. “Oh, I’ve been all around. I tell you, the things you have to do to get respect... I still have trouble walking straight.”</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.c1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.o1>That's too much info.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o1.o3.o1>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o2>Act like someone’s calling you on the radio.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o1.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot2.o2>Sneak by.</eventtext.miketheidiot2.o2>
<eventtext.miketheidiot.nomoney>“Mike knows many things, and he'll tell you some. But only if you have the coin.”</eventtext.miketheidiot.nomoney>
<eventtext.firefighting.c1>You notice a thin trail of smoke rising from a trash can.</eventtext.firefighting.c1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1>Investigate.</eventtext.firefighting.o1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1.c1>There is a lit cigarette in the trash. It seems dangerously close to igniting a larger flame.</eventtext.firefighting.o1.c1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1.o1>Put it out.</eventtext.firefighting.o1.o1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1.o1.c1>You get some minor burns when you fish the cigarette out and stomp out the fledgling fire, but nothing major.</eventtext.firefighting.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.firefighting.o1.o2>See what happens.</eventtext.firefighting.o1.o2>
<eventtext.firefighting.o2>Not my problem.</eventtext.firefighting.o2>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.c1>Some workers are huddled together, playing a game with dice. They have piled various items together, presumably as prizes for the winner. Among them is a shiny, symmetrical item. You recognize it as alien, and probably worth more than the other items combined.</eventtext.sleightofhand.c1>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o1>Join the game and attempt to win the item for yourself.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o1>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o1.c1>You quickly deduce that it’s a game of pure luck. You take a few careful risks and it pays off. You walk away with the prized alien ornament.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o1.c1>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o1.c2>Unsurprisingly, the other players are more experienced in the game than you. After betting a sizeable amount of cash, you walk away with nothing. You have lost 500 marks.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o1.c2>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o2>Create a distraction and try to snatch it without anyone noticing.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o2>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o2.c1>You start yelling “Fire! Fire!” and quickly grab the item in the ensuing chaos. You hide it deep in your pocket. It’s time to go before they’re any wiser.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o2.c1>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o2.c2>You start yelling “Fire! Fire!” and quickly grab the item in the ensuing chaos. However, one of them catches you in the act and calls security.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o2.c2>
<eventtext.sleightofhand.o3>Keep moving.</eventtext.sleightofhand.o3>
<eventtext.foreshadowing.c1>You feel the faintest of tugs near your pants. When you finally get some space, you find someone has slipped a note in your pocket.</eventtext.foreshadowing.c1>
<eventtext.foreshadowing.o1>Read it.</eventtext.foreshadowing.o1>
<eventtext.foreshadowing.o1.c1>It states: “The truth is out there. cbspusbvnbhbnf.dpn/efsfmjdu/beweht.htm”</eventtext.foreshadowing.o1.c1>
<eventtext.foreshadowing.o2>Toss it.</eventtext.foreshadowing.o2>
<eventtext.separatistrelations.c1>You run into some separatists. Being on friendly terms with them, you receive some insight into how this place functions.</eventtext.separatistrelations.c1>
<eventtext.separatistrelations.c2>You see some separatists creating their trademark art on an unsuspecting trash can.</eventtext.separatistrelations.c2>
<eventtext.separatistrelations.o1>Confront them.</eventtext.separatistrelations.o1>
<eventtext.separatistrelations.o1.c1>“Hey! That’s official property!” you decide to yell. The youngsters stop what they’re doing and attack you.</eventtext.separatistrelations.o1.c1>
<eventtext.separatistrelations.o2>Help them.</eventtext.separatistrelations.o2>
<eventtext.separatistrelations.o2.c1>You act as a lookout for the two activists. When they finish their masterpiece, you exchange a few words. They deem you loyal to their cause and promise to put a good word in for you.</eventtext.separatistrelations.o2.c1>
<eventtext.separatistrelations.o3>Ignore them.</eventtext.separatistrelations.o3>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.c1>Someone is handing out flyers advertising some kind of a communion. You spot a familiar-looking logo in the corner. It’s just the local husk cult members proselytizing. It might be fun to check out the ritual.</eventtext.huskcultrelations.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1>Sure, what’s the worst that could happen?</eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.c1>You make your way into the advertised dorm. It’s the usual stuff: “Fleshbags” this and “ascension” that. The local chapter guys are very friendly and they invite you to partake of the communion.</eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.o1>“Don’t mind if I do.”</eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.o1.c1>You gulp down some husk eggs. A bit salty. Afterwards you joke around with the folks a bit and you part in good spirits. You’ve made some lifelong friends here tonight. That reminds you to pick up some husk antidote at the counter and take some of it pretty soon-ish.</eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.o2>Make up an excuse to leave.</eventtext.huskcultrelations.o1.o2>
<eventtext.huskcultrelations.o2>Suicide cults are fun but not for me.</eventtext.huskcultrelations.o2>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1>The engineering crew chief working on a beaten-up old shuttle engine scowls at you for a moment, as if sizing you up.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.c1>You there, you look halfway competent. Give me a hand with this engine.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.c1>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o1>Refuse.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o1>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o1.c1>You decline as tactfully as you can but he’s clearly not happy. He shakes his head and silently goes back to work, trying to refit the engine.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2>Help him with his engine.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2.c1>You roll up your sleeves and get to work refitting the engine with him. After a few minutes of work you both manage to get it running. “Thanks. I’m sure I’d have got it going on my own eventually but you’ve saved me some time. Let me know if you want any work done on your sub and I’ll see about giving you a little discount for your trouble.”</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2.c2>You roll up your sleeves and get to work refitting the engine with him. In spite of your best efforts though, the engine refuses to start. He slams shut the access panel. “Well I guess this is one for the scrappers. Thanks for the help anyhow.”</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.o2.c2>
<eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.c2>He clearly doesn’t care much for what he sees and returns to his work. Apparently you’ve somehow not passed muster.</eventtext.engineers_are_special.c1.c2>
<eventtext.mediator.c1>Two workers are arguing loudly. What once might have been a civil discussion about inter-Europan politics has devolved into a shouting match—it isn’t readily apparent how the other guy’s mother factors into it.</eventtext.mediator.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1>Try to calm the situation down.</eventtext.mediator.o1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.c1>You move a bit closer. For a moment, the two loudmouths stop arguing and look at you.</eventtext.mediator.o1.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o1>“Hey fellas. Not my place to interrupt, but they can hear your conversation back in Versas.”</eventtext.mediator.o1.o1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o1.c1>The two workers are humbled by your parental demeanor. They quiet down and get back to their duties.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o1.c2>They are even more pissed off now, but this time at you. Your condescending manner of speaking does you no favors.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2>“I suggest you two shut your traps before I finish counting to three. One…”</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.c1>They get the feeling you have the means to back up your words. The two workers go quiet in a record time.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.c2>They look at you bemusedly.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.c2>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1>Two...</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.c1>They look at each other. Clearly, they’re shaking in their boots.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.o1>Three.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.o1>
<eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>A smile appears on the other’s face and you smile at him in turn. You feel powerful. Your smile quickly turns into a frown when they grab their tools and walk toward you with ill intent.</eventtext.mediator.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o2>Egg them on.</eventtext.mediator.o2>
<eventtext.mediator.o2.c1>You don’t know exactly what’s going on, but join in the shouting anyway. “Remember what he said about your mom?” “That shit doesn’t fly where I’m from!” You feel giddy as the shouting crescendos into a fistfight and the two workers start reaching for their tools. It might be a good time to vanish from the area.</eventtext.mediator.o2.c1>
<eventtext.mediator.o3>Nothing to see here. Keep walking.</eventtext.mediator.o3>
<eventtext.blackmarket.c1>“Hey! Got something for ya here if you’re interested…”</eventtext.blackmarket.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1>Listen to what they have to say.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1>“I happened to find some nice alien contraband. It’s yours for 1,000 marks. I’ll throw in a power cell too. What do you say?” He opens his coat to reveal a pistol that looks like genuine alien tech.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.c1>Do you want to buy the pistol for 1,000 marks?</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1>Yes, please.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1.c1>He hands you the pistol. It’s a genuine article.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1.c2>He shoves the pistol in your hand and quickly shuffles off. On a closer look, the pistol is actually a children’s toy. You angrily toss it aside.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o2>No thanks.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c1.o2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2>“I found some weird eggs in the vents. Dunno what they are but figured they’d mean something for someone like you.” He flashes some eggs but it’s too dark to make out which species. He quickly hides them before you can ascertain their nature. “500 marks.”</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.c2>Do you want to buy the eggs for 500 marks?</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.c2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1>Yes, please.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1.c1>He carefully places the eggs in your hand. Most of them are actually oversized marbles, but one is a genuine mudraptor egg. “This can potentially cause a lot of damage,” you think to yourself as you stow it safely inside your jacket.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1.c2>In the light, the eggs are instantly recognizable as “Velonaceps Calyx,” otherwise known as husk eggs.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o1.c2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o2>No thanks.</eventtext.blackmarket.o1.c2.o2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.o2>Ignore.</eventtext.blackmarket.o2>
<eventtext.blackmarket.nomoney>“Not enough cash? I thought the submarine business paid well...”</eventtext.blackmarket.nomoney>
<eventtext.huskcultist.c1>“Hello, fellow traveler!” a pale figure greets you. You’re slightly taken aback by their cheerfulness. “Would you happen to have any eggs of the species Velonaceps Calyx? I’ll pay good money for each one you come across in your travels.” Their facade momentarily slips and you can hear them muttering under their breath. You can make out “disgusting meatsack” and something about “ascending.”</eventtext.huskcultist.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1>Check your pockets for eggs.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.c1>You check your pockets. As luck would have it, you have some husk eggs on you.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o1>Sell the eggs for 1,000 marks.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o1.c1>You exchange the eggs for money, which you count immediately. It's all there.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o2>Give the eggs for free.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o2>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o2.c1>You decide to donate the eggs for free. The person seems overjoyed.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o3>Actually, I'll keep these for now.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o3>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.c2>You check your pockets. You're fresh out of husk eggs.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.c2>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o4>“I don't have the eggs on me but I'll go get some.”</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o4>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o4.c1>“I'll be here,” the person whispers. It sends shivers down your spine.</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o4.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o5>“Sorry, don't have any.”</eventtext.huskcultist.o1.o5>
<eventtext.huskcultist.o2>Uhh...probably best to keep moving.</eventtext.huskcultist.o2>
<eventtext.fanclub.c1>A crowd of teens has gathered to observe the newcomers to their outpost. They’re loudly arguing about which is the coolest job on board a submarine.</eventtext.fanclub.c1>
<eventtext.fanclub.o1>Talk to them.</eventtext.fanclub.o1>
<eventtext.fanclub.o1.c1>They have an endless amount of questions. You answer them diligently, and in the end you have the feeling a few of them are going to grow up to be seafarers. Remember: If they wind up as crawler food, it’ll be blood on your hands.</eventtext.fanclub.o1.c1>
<eventtext.fanclub.o2>Ignore them.</eventtext.fanclub.o2>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.c1>Two pale characters with bags under their eyes approach. They’re reaching for something under their clothes. You feel threatened.</eventtext.huskcultambush.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o1>“Hey, fellas. What’s—uh... What’s this?”</eventtext.huskcultambush.o1>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o1.c1>The two figures draw out sharp knives and lunge at you.</eventtext.huskcultambush.o1.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o2>“Easy, dear brothers. My time for ascension isn’t here yet.”</eventtext.huskcultambush.o2>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o2.c1>They stop their approach, apologize for the confusion and the three of you grab some crawler cocktails and laugh it off. They share information on this outpost.</eventtext.huskcultambush.o2.c1>
<eventtext.huskcultambush.o2.c2>The two figures draw out sharp knives and lunge at you.</eventtext.huskcultambush.o2.c2>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo1.c1>“We hired a crew to transport these materials, but they never showed. The stuff is still here if you want the job.”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo1.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo2.c1>“Got some real 'handle with care' cargo sitting in the bay. Normally I wouldn't trust them with any new face but I hear you've proved yourselves.”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo2.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_cargo3.c1>“These research materials are sorely needed in the neighboring outpost. It's imperative they get to their destination intact.”</eventtext.missionevent_cargo3.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_killswarm.c1>“No transport ship can leave without running into a swarm of monsters. Take care of the problem and there's a reward in it for you.”</eventtext.missionevent_killswarm.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_killmonstercommon.c1>“There's this especially mean monster terrorizing the caves near here. I've put a little reward aside for the crew that takes it down.”</eventtext.missionevent_killmonstercommon.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_killmonsterrare.c1>“I've heard reports of a gargantuan monster somewhere in the vicinity. If you want to try hunting it down, be my guest. Just make sure you're prepared. It's a dangerous one.”</eventtext.missionevent_killmonsterrare.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_salvageartifact.c1>“We picked up a signal nearby. The eggheads say it could be something alien. If you check it out, there'd be some marks in it for you.”</eventtext.missionevent_salvageartifact.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_salvagewreck.c1>“We received a distress signal from a vessel that was carrying some sensitive cargo. The contents are probably long gone by now but the captain's logbook should shed some light on what happened to it. I want you to recover it.”</eventtext.missionevent_salvagewreck.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_killmonster.c1>“I posted about an assignment earlier. Sent the details to your onboard navigation system too, in case you're interested.”</eventtext.missionevent_killmonster.c1>

<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.c1>There are flyers with notices for various jobs. One of them is for ferrying a few boxes of clowning equipment to a neighboring outpost. It states: “If interested, imitate your favorite bird.”</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o1>“Krruu!”</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o1.c1>A distant sound of a bike horn confirms you as the recipient of the assignment. A container is waiting for you when you leave the outpost.</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o1.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o2>“Caw! Caw!”</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o2>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o2.c1>A distant sound of a bike horn confirms you as the recipient of the assignment. A container is waiting for you when you leave the outpost.</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o2.c1>
<eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o3>Stay silent.</eventtext.missionevent_clownoutbreak.o3>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1>An announcement comes over the PA. “Calling the crew of the vessel that just docked. Please send a representative to see the security chief in administration.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1>“You're one of the new arrivals? Good. I have a sensitive issue I can't trust any of my own employees with.” The chief pauses for a second, sizing you up, then continues. “In usual circumstances, I wouldn't ask for help from just anyone, but I'm running out of options. Needless to say, I need you to keep this to yourself. Are you interested?”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1>“Tell me more.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.c1>The chief nods. “According to intel we managed to gather earlier, we can expect a separatist prison break soon,” they state, matter-of-factly. “Prison breaks are already a nasty business, but to complicate matters I have reason to believe they have a man on the inside.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1>“Pun intended?”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.c1>“I'm talking about inside the security force.” It seems like sense of humor isn't how one makes it to chief of security. “To cut to the chase, I need to make sure all my personnel are on the level and take precautions. Here's what I want you to do. Take these microphones and hide them in the crew quarters.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o1>Accept the mission.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You pick up some small surveillance microphones. “One more thing. I can't permit this kind of surveillance in an official capacity. If you get caught, you're on your own.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o2>“I'd rather not get involved.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o2>“I'd rather not get involved.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.c1>These must be the quarters the chief was talking about.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1>Hide microphones under the bunks.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c1>You quickly stuff the mics in footlockers under the bunks. The sound coming through is a bit muffled but serviceable. Return to the chief to receive your payment.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c1.c1>“Good work. Here's your payment. We never spoke.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c2>You toss the mics under a bunk. When you turn around to leave, you run into a security guard. “What are you up to?” they ask.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1>“Oh, just some calisthenics. Need to stay in shape for emergencies.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c1>The guard seems satisfied with the explanation and goes back to their rounds. Return to the chief to receive your payment.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c1.c1>“Good work. Here's your payment. We never spoke.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c2>“You look like you've never done an honest day's work in your life.” They start inspecting undersides of the bunks. Now would be a good time to vanish before they get any wiser. This mission is a failure.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c2.c2>The guard draws their weapon. “Microphones, huh? You need to come with me.” Now would be a REALLY good time to run.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o1.c2.c2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2>“Just installing some surveillance mics.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2.c1>The guard lets out a brief chuckle. “A funny guy. You shouldn't be here. Go on, git.” The guard then turns their attention to the cameras. Now would be a good time to vanish before they get any wiser. This mission is a failure.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2.c1.c1>The guard draws their weapon. “Microphones, huh? You need to come with me.” Now would be a REALLY good time to run.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o1.o2.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2>Hide microphones inside some electronics.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c1>You open up a nearby transistor radio and install a microphone inside the speaker, out of sight. Return to the chief to receive your payment.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c1.c1>“Good work. Here's your payment. We never spoke.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c2>You spot a transistor radio that could possibly hold a microphone. As you're fiddling with it, a security guard calls out. “You! Come here!” You decide to comply for now. “What were you doing?” the guard demands.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.c2>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1>“Fixing the radio antenna.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1.c1>“Finally. Make sure K-Rawler comes through loud and clear.” Something will come through all right, you think to yourself. Return to the chief to receive your payment.</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1.c1>
<eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1.c1.c1>“Good work. Here's your payment. We never spoke.”</eventtext.bigbrother.c1.c1.o2.o1.c1.c1>

<eventtext.tastetest.c1>In a nearby trash can, there are two small bottles of clear liquid. Both of them are labeled with a different chemical formula.</eventtext.tastetest.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1>Take a closer look at the bottles.</eventtext.tastetest.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.c1>Neither solution is anything you’re especially familiar with, but you are reasonably sure one of them is strongly acidic. You decide to leave the acid be. The other bottle is a total mystery to you.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1>Bottoms up!</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.c1>The solution has a slightly mellow and sweet quality to it and it leaves a lingering aftertaste of apricot. It seems to have no other effects. You decide to leave the bottles in the trash and continue on.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1>Not bad.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.c1>After a while, you realize drinking the solution has made all your pains disappear. For the first time in forever, you feel good. You don't know what the solution is but you wish you had some more. Maybe there's some more in the trash?</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.o1>Maybe I should take another look in there.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>You return to the trash can and find a couple more bottles. None of them are the same as the one you drank but maybe they can be of some other use.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o2>Not a very sensible thing to do...</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o2>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.c2>Chemistry makes no sense to you; it might as well be an alien language. After a quick shake test, either liquid seems perfectly safe to you. One of them has a blue label, the other green. Do you want to try one of them?</eventtext.tastetest.o1.c2>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3>Blue label.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.c1>The solution has a slightly mellow and sweet quality to it and it leaves a lingering aftertaste of apricot. It seems to have no other effects. You decide to leave the bottles in the trash and continue on.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o3.c1>

<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4>Green label.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4.c1>The liquid burns your throat a bit when you swallow it. At first, the effect isn’t unlike a good Jovian vodka, and the prospect of getting buzzed while spending no money appeals to you greatly. The situation suddenly takes a turn for the worse when you feel like your stomach is on fire. A sharp pain causes you to double over in agony. Who would’ve thought drinking something out of the trash was a bad idea?</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4.c1>
<eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4.o1>Not good.</eventtext.tastetest.o1.o4.o1>

<eventtext.crawleroutbreak.c1>A panicked researcher runs past you. “God dammit Jimmy, I told you we should’ve went with padlocks instead of these electronic pieces of shit!”</eventtext.crawleroutbreak.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.c1>As you step inside the office, the manager notices you. “I suppose you're here about the situation in the mines?” he asks.</eventtext.consultant.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1>“Uh...sure. Remind me what the situation was, again?”</eventtext.consultant.o1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.c1>It turns out the miners have halted the work in the mines because of a toxic gas leak. “They're demanding ridiculous hazard pay and we just don't have the budget for that. That's why you're here, right? To negotiate a better deal?”</eventtext.consultant.o1.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1>“Yes, that's right. Get me in contact with the foreman.”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1>“They can probably be found near the main mineshaft. Good luck.”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.c1>The foreman is pacing back and forth, loudly arguing with someone on the radio. You only catch the tail end of their discussion. “There aren't enough diving masks for the whole crew. Even if there were, we couldn't waste the oxygen keeping them on all day long. ...No, the ventilation in the mines is connected to the rest of the outpost so we can't risk pumping it out either.” Exasperated, he looks at you. “Are you here about the gas leaks?”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1>Haggle for lower hazard pay for miners.</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>You successfully explain that not everyone can be paid extra for hazardous work. This will probably result in most of the crew walking out and the rest having to work their asses off, but at least you got paid a hefty consultant fee.</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1.c2>The foreman stands their ground. No hazard pay, no digging. At least you tried.</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o1.c2>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2>“What kind of gases are we talking about?”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.c1>“Mercury gases. Colorless, odorless, gives you breathing problems real quick.”</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.c1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1>Come up with a solution to help with mercury exposure.</eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1>
<eventtext.consultant.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1>“A combination of iron, Stabilozine and crawler liver should keep your lungs clean of mercury.

<EventText.shockjock.o1.c2>“Recreational drug use is on the rise, people. Have you heard about “Cult of the Husk”? A bunch of weirdos abusing biohazardous materials? And the establishment does nothing about it!”</EventText.shockjock.o1.c2>
<EventText.shockjock.o1.o2.c1>“And don't get me started on casual opioid use that's rampant everywhere! According to trusted sources, the Coalition is putting something in them, making them addicting!

<EventText.shockjock.o1.c3>“Dear listeners, if I was the Coalition president, I would walk right into the crew quarters, set up my little podium and say, “Listen, citizens, if you vote against military spending and a separatist army marches in and blows you up, we're not going to do anything about it.””</EventText.shockjock.o1.c3>
<EventText.shockjock.o1.o3.c1>“You want to cry about your ruined little station? Give us your money next time! Anyway, that's what I would say, if I was the president.”</EventText.shockjock.o1.o3.c1>

<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.c1>“Jacov Subra. He's a weird guy who put together these - how should I put it - “themed” festivals.” The person rolls their eyes. “Full of husks. Multiple fatalities. He had a high profile trial a while back. You might have read about it on the Europan. Anyway.”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.c1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.c1>“They caught him here a week ago. From what I heard, he had held another disastrous festival nearby, and was sent to the mines.”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.o1>“That's good news.”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Good news, until he slipped away again.” A tone signals that the break is over. The worker puts the paper away and starts towards the dock. “I hear they put up a reward for whoever brings him to custody”, they yell over their shoulder.</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o2>“What's he done now?”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o2>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o3>“Don't address me, trash.”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra2.o3>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra3.c1>“Welcome to the annual “Church of the Mollusc” festival! Featuring: Sonata Aquatica, Jethro Hull, Irma-Donna, Draft Bunk and many more! With a special appearance by Sacov Jubra!” The word “mollusc” is written on top of a scribbled out “husk”. Seems like the festival is being held nearby. A passerby exclaims: “Draft Bunk is playing! Sweet!”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra3.c1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra3.o1>Interesting.</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra3.o1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.c1>“You'll never take me alive!”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.c1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1>“Give up, Jacov! You're coming with me!”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.c1>“I'm not going anywhere! I'm innocent! Look, I'll pay you!”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.c1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1>“Save it for the judge.”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.c1>“Been there, done that.” Jacov smiles devilishly. “What makes you think I won't run away again?”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o1>“Not my problem.”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o1.c1>“I can see your heart isn't in this. I'll give you three thousand marks and you let me walk out of here. Deal?”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.deal>“Deal.”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.deal>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.neversaw>“Here's the money. We never saw each other.”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.neversaw>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.nodeal>“No deal. Come along now, quietly.”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.nodeal>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.run>As soon as the words leave your lips, Jacov hurls a fistful of coins at your head and turns to run away.</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.run>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2>“Maybe I'll put a bullet in your leg.”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.c1>Jacov is sweating profusely. “Surely you wouldn't shoot an unarmed man?”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.o1>“Absolutely I would.” (Attack)</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.o1>

<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.o2.c1>Fine, I'll come quietly.</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o1.o2.o2.c1>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o2>“How much?”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o2>
<EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o2.c1>“Three thousand for you and we part as friends, right here.”</EventText.assassinationofjacovsubra4.o1.o2.c1>

<EventText.infiltration.c1>The station manager looks at you with haggard eyes. “You're one of the new arrivals? Man, am I glad to see a non-masked face.”</EventText.infiltration.c1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1>“Now that you mention it, there are a lot of masks around.”</EventText.infiltration.o1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.c1>“A bunch of clowns. Let me ask you, you ever wake up in the middle of the night to a sound of bike horns? They don't even attempt any kind of melody, just honking away all willy-nilly. I haven't had a full night's sleep in... days?” They stare blankly into space. “Weeks?”</EventText.infiltration.o1.c1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1>“Sounds horrible. What do they want?”</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.c1>“Who knows? I've tried talking to them, offering money, threatening to kick them out, you name it, I've tried it. I think they're content with torturing me and the rest of the crew.”</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1>Offer to help.</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.c1>“The manager scoffs. “Tell you what. You get them to leave, there's a...” Their eyes narrow as they study you. “Thousand marks for you. One more thing. No physical violence. While I personally wouldn't shed any tears for roughed up clowns, we have rules here we adhere to.”</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Not even a little?”</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“No.”</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2>“Got it.”</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>You approach a clown. They stare at you.</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>Threaten the clown.</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.c1>You stare the clown down for a minute. They try to grab your nose but you slap their arm away. You point to the direction of the airlock. With slumped shoulders, the clown shuffles away, their friends in tow.</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.c1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1>Mission complete.</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>It's suddenly very quiet. You report your success to the manager on the radio and one thousand marks are deposited to your account.</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.c2>You strain to flex your biceps. For some reason this only succeeds in making the clown laugh in your face and continue their merriments.</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.c2>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2>Mission failed.</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2.c1>You have missed your chance at making an impactful impression and dejectedly report failure to the station manager.</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2>Build rapport.</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2.c1>You try to reason with the clowns, explaining that their behaviour is disrupting the lives of the crew here and frankly, quite unacceptable. Your words fall to deaf ears.</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o1.o2.o2.c1>
<EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o2>“Well, good luck with that.”</EventText.infiltration.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.infiltration.o2>“Don't speak to me, you harlequin-hater.”</EventText.infiltration.o2>
<EventText.badvibrations1.c1>A sound of shattering glass makes you jump. Someone is slouched against the wall, shards of glass at her feet. By the looks of it, it might have been a bottle of rum she was holding. She's muttering under her breath.</EventText.badvibrations1.c1>
<EventText.badvibrations1.o1>“You okay?”</EventText.badvibrations1.o1>
<EventText.badvibrations1.o1.c1>No response. You notice she's repeating the same thing over and over. “Bad vibrations, man. Bad vibes.” Drool is slowly dripping from the corner of her mouth onto her jacket.</EventText.badvibrations1.o1.c1>
<EventText.badvibrations1.o1.o1>Try to help her.</EventText.badvibrations1.o1.o1>
<EventText.badvibrations1.o1.o1.c1>You're wondering about the person's mental health, when they unexpectedly swing around and grab you by the collar. “Bad vibrations, do you hear me?” A sudden realization dawns on her when she recognizes you as a member of a submarine crew. “You can help me”, she pleads. “We found a relic. Turned it on. In the structure. Deep.” She lets up her grasp on you for a second.</EventText.badvibrations1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.badvibrations1.o1.o1.o1>“You're making no sense.”</EventText.badvibrations1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.badvibrations1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The madness seems to have found it's way back to cloud her mind. “I was first! I know! I got the trophy!”</EventText.badvibrations1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.badvibrations1.stepback>Take a step back.</EventText.badvibrations1.stepback>
<EventText.badvibrations1.raving>You wonder what the person is raving about. A relic inside a structure? Something in the ruins? You make a note to check it out if you have time.</EventText.badvibrations1.raving>
<EventText.badvibrations1.notmyproblem>Not my problem.</EventText.badvibrations1.notmyproblem>
<EventText.badvibrations2.c1>Touching the artifact's etched surface causes an almost imperceptible itch inside your head.</EventText.badvibrations2.c1>
<EventText.badvibrations2.o1>Drop the artifact.</EventText.badvibrations2.o1>
<EventText.badvibrations2.o1.c1>For some reason, you find it very difficult to drop the item, and it remains in your hands. The itch builds up into a slight vibrating feeling in your skull.</EventText.badvibrations2.o1.c1>
<EventText.badvibrations2.o1.o1>Throw away the artifact.</EventText.badvibrations2.o1.o1>
<EventText.badvibrations2.o1.o1.c1>It's as if you've forgotten how to move your arms. Your head feels uncomfortably warm and numb. It's getting more and more challenging to keep your focus on anything.</EventText.badvibrations2.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.badvibrations2.o1.o1.o1>Sleep.</EventText.badvibrations2.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.badvibrations2.o1.o1.o1.c1>You close your eyes. This seems like as good a place as any to have a nap. Jupiter knows you've earned one. You let yourself fall back into a dreamless sleep.</EventText.badvibrations2.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.badvibrations2.inspect>Inspect the artifact more closely.</EventText.badvibrations2.inspect>
<EventText.badvibrations2.protrusion>As you run your hands across the item's surface, you hit a protrusion. At once, the numbness inside subsides and you are again fully aware of your surroundings. Time to get this artifact somewhere it can be kept safe.</EventText.badvibrations2.protrusion>
<EventText.badvibrations3.c1>Somebody is trying to get your attention. “Hey! I've been looking for you.” She looks vaguely familiar. “You don't remember me, do you?”</EventText.badvibrations3.c1>
<EventText.badvibrations3.o1>“Oh yeah, you're the one with the, uh, vibrations.”</EventText.badvibrations3.o1>
<EventText.badvibrations3.gotbetter>“So, I got better. Suppose that is because you turned the thing off?” She crosses her arms. “Wanted to come say thanks.”</EventText.badvibrations3.gotbetter>
<EventText.badvibrations3.welcome>“You're welcome.”</EventText.badvibrations3.welcome>
<EventText.badvibrations3.anotherthing>“There's another thing. Because I was... unwell, I got booted from the crew I was with back then. I was thinking I could join up with you guys? I'm pretty handy with all things mechanical or electrical.” She looks strong and capable now that she's not being hindered by an external influence.</EventText.badvibrations3.anotherthing>
<EventText.badvibrations3.merrier>“Sure. The more the merrier.”</EventText.badvibrations3.merrier>
<EventText.badvibrations3.seeyouonboard>“Great. I'll see you on board.”</EventText.badvibrations3.seeyouonboard>
<EventText.badvibrations3.full>“Sorry, we're full for now.”</EventText.badvibrations3.full>
<EventText.badvibrations3.hangout>“Well, I guess I'll hang out here 'til I find something.”</EventText.badvibrations3.hangout>
<EventText.badvibrations3.reward>Ask for a reward.</EventText.badvibrations3.reward>
<EventText.badvibrations3.scrounge>“Oh. Uh, I can scrounge up a few hundred marks if you like. I'll send 'em to you as soon as possible.”</EventText.badvibrations3.scrounge>
<EventText.badvibrations3.o2>“You're the fortuneteller, right?”</EventText.badvibrations3.o2>
<EventText.badvibrations3.o2.c1>“Huh?” She looks confused and mildly annoyed. “No, you're mistaking me with someone else. I ran into you earlier when I was still having... trouble with a certain relic. You know, with the “bad vibes” and all.”</EventText.badvibrations3.o2.c1>
<EventText.badvibrations3.o2.o1>“Now I remember.”</EventText.badvibrations3.o2.o1>
<EventText.manandhisraptor1.c1>A distressed looking person is pacing in circles in the hall. When they see you, their eyes light up. “You're from that sub that just docked, aren't you? Do you take passengers?”</EventText.manandhisraptor1.c1>
<EventText.manandhisraptor1.o1>“I am indeed. What type of passengers?”</EventText.manandhisraptor1.o1>
<EventText.manandhisraptor1.o1.c1>“Just me and Rex. We're supposed to visit nana in the next town over, but for some reason nobody wants us on board.” The person can't keep eye contact for more than a second and keeps glancing over their shoulder.</EventText.manandhisraptor1.o1.c1>
<EventText.manandhisraptor1.o1.o1>Be suspicious.</EventText.manandhisraptor1.o1.o1>
<EventText.manandhisraptor1.o1.o1.c1>There are always vessels traveling these waters, eager to make some extra moolah by taking on passengers. You open your mouth, trying to voice your suspicions about the situation. “Wh-”, you start, but the person interrupts you. “I'll pay you three thousand. One when we leave, two when we get there.”</EventText.manandhisraptor1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.manandhisraptor1.takeonboard>Take the person on board.</EventText.manandhisraptor1.takeonboard>
<EventText.manandhisraptor1.great>“Great!”, they exclaim. “I'll get Rex and we'll meet you on board!” What a happy fellow. Hopefully their money is good.</EventText.manandhisraptor1.great>
<EventText.manandhisraptor1.o2>“Nope.”</EventText.manandhisraptor1.o2>
<EventText.manandhisraptor2.c1>You're inspecting the sub when the person you talked to at the station peeks out from a cabin, with a wide smile on their face. “You ready to meet Rex?” Before you can utter a response, the biggest mudraptor you've ever seen jumps out behind them.</EventText.manandhisraptor2.c1>
<EventText.manandhisraptor2.o1>“Watch out!”</EventText.manandhisraptor2.o1>
<EventText.manandhisraptor2.o1.c1>You yell out and reach for a weapon, but the creature only tilts its head and looks at you quizzically. “Isn't he a cutie?” This is Rex? They brought a mudraptor on board? “Be careful, though. Rex gets ornery on long trips. Don't you, boy? Yes you do!” Great.</EventText.manandhisraptor2.o1.c1>
<EventText.manandhisraptor2.c1.c1>Rex is pacing back and forth.</EventText.manandhisraptor2.c1.c1>
<EventText.heartofgold.c1>As you approach, this bandit throws down their weapon. “Ah fuck it, I give up. Don't shoot!”</EventText.heartofgold.c1>
<EventText.heartofgold.o1>“Too late for that. Say your prayers.”</EventText.heartofgold.o1>
<EventText.heartofgold.o1.c1>The bandit reaches for their weapon on the ground. “Do your worst!”</EventText.heartofgold.o1.c1>
<EventText.heartofgold.o2>Talk to them.</EventText.heartofgold.o2>
<EventText.heartofgold.o2.c1>“Thanks for not offing me, I guess.” The bandit squats down and wipes sweat off his brow. “I've never fired that, you know”, he says, pointing to the gun on the floor. “Not cut out for this shit.”</EventText.heartofgold.o2.c1>
<EventText.heartofgold.goodluck>“Well, good luck with everything.”</EventText.heartofgold.goodluck>
<EventText.heartofgold.wait>“Wait!” The bandit cries out and jumps to their feet. “Can I come with you? I know a lot about chemistry. I could cook you meds!”</EventText.heartofgold.wait>
<EventText.heartofgold.okay>“Okay, I suppose.”</EventText.heartofgold.okay>
<EventText.heartofgold.signingbonus>“All right! We can sort out a signing bonus later.”</EventText.heartofgold.signingbonus>
<EventText.heartofgold.whatamigonnado>“Well what am I gonna do then? Wait 'till another sub comes through guns blazing?”</EventText.heartofgold.whatamigonnado>
<EventText.heartofgold.onyourown>“You're on your own.”</EventText.heartofgold.onyourown>
<EventText.heartofgold.o2.o2>“What are you even doing here?”</EventText.heartofgold.o2.o2>
<EventText.heartofgold.o2.o2.c1>“I was captured along with the rest of my crew and sub. They're all gone now.” They scowl. “Eaten. They were used as bait for the crawlers that used to inhabit this place. I was spared because I know how to make morphine and fent.”</EventText.heartofgold.o2.o2.c1>
<EventText.heartofgold.o2.o2.o1>“You're a drug dealer?”</EventText.heartofgold.o2.o2.o1>
<EventText.heartofgold.o2.o2.o1.c1>“Give me a break. Like you haven't done any opiates yourself? The way I see it I provided a service and, in return, nobody pointed a gun my way.” A dry smile creeps on their face. “Until you, that is.”</EventText.heartofgold.o2.o2.o1.c1>
<EventText.bombscare.c1>“Hey, you there.”</EventText.bombscare.c1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1>“Me?”</EventText.bombscare.o1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.c1>The guard takes a long look at you. “Nevermind. I thought you looked like someone else. You're free to go.”</EventText.bombscare.o1.c1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o1>“What's going on?”</EventText.bombscare.o1.o1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.c1>“Just be careful”, the guard cautions. “We received a bomb threat a few hours ago, by some usual suspects. It's been a while and no bomb has been found, but we advise caution.”</EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1>“Usual suspects?”</EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1>The guard lowers their voice. “Look, you better stay clear of this separatist business. There have been some serious attacks lately. Just come to me if you see something suspicious.”</EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>Out of the corner of your eye, you see a pile of scrap electronics.</EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>Salvage.</EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>To your surprise, the pile of scrap turns out to be a homemade pipe bomb. As luck would have it some wires have come loose, preventing the bomb from going off. You carefully remove the detonator, pick up the bomb and place it in your bag. The guard from earlier should be interested in seeing this.</EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1.c1>You thrust the bomb to the arms of the guard, who flinches a bit. You recount your experience and the guard thanks you for finding the bomb and gives you a small reward for dismantling it.</EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1.c1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c2>To your surprise, the pile of scrap is wired to a timer. You turn it around and see “00:01” displayed on the timer.</EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c2>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>Take cover.</EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>You drop the bomb and dive down onto the floor, covering your head with your hands. Seconds pass by, but nothing happens. Gingerly, you stand up and dust yourself off. Seems like this bomb is a dud. The guard from earlier should be interested in seeing this.</EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1.c1>You report finding a bomb in the hallway and the guard immediately springs to action. They thank you for finding and reporting the bomb.</EventText.bombscare.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<EventText.bombscare.o1.o2>Leave the guard.</EventText.bombscare.o1.o2>
<EventText.terrorism101.c1>You see a person crouched next to a vending machine, assembling or fixing something.</EventText.terrorism101.c1>
<EventText.terrorism101.o1>Find out what they're working on.</EventText.terrorism101.o1>
<EventText.terrorism101.o1.c1>You sneak behind the person and crane your neck. It seems they're fiddling with some kind of a device with lots of wires. They glance back and jump up when they see you. “Shit! Don't just stand there!”</EventText.terrorism101.o1.c1>
<EventText.terrorism101.o1.o1>“Sorry.”</EventText.terrorism101.o1.o1>
<EventText.terrorism101.o1.o1.c1>“It's all right, I guess.” They check their pulse and exhale deeply. “I've been a wreck ever since my medication was pulled. Couldn't afford it, they said. Then they went ahead and installed these fuckin' things.” Irate, the dweller kicks the vending machine.</EventText.terrorism101.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.terrorism101.o1.o1.o1>“So what are you doing?”</EventText.terrorism101.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.terrorism101.excuse>“I, uh...” Their eyes dart around, looking for something. “I'm building a, um...” They're sweating profusely.</EventText.terrorism101.excuse>
<EventText.terrorism101.abomb>“A bomb?”</EventText.terrorism101.abomb>
<EventText.terrorism101.shh>“SHHH! Not so loud!”, they hiss. Then they continue, whispering. “Yes, it's a bomb. But it's also so much more. It's a symbol of discontent against our overlords. We must topple the monuments of oppression, like this one here.” They spit on the vending machine. “But that's hypothetical at this point, 'cause I don't actually know how to arm this symbol.”</EventText.terrorism101.shh>
<EventText.terrorism101.help>“I could help you with that.”</EventText.terrorism101.help>
<EventText.terrorism101.novice>The novice terrorist scrutinizes you for a minute, then warily hands you a bunch of wires. “I think I can trust you”, they say.</EventText.terrorism101.novice>
<EventText.terrorism101.armbomb>Arm the bomb.</EventText.terrorism101.armbomb>
<EventText.terrorism101.bombarmed>It's only a matter of connecting the detonator wire to get the bomb armed. You hand the bomb to the person and they give you some change and a promise to talk you up to their Separatist friends.</EventText.terrorism101.bombarmed>

<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.c1>This colony is in a hurry. Lots of workers are loading supplies onto submarines.  You see a pair of them arguing quietly and gesturing towards you.</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.c1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1>Walk up to them.</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.c1>On your approach, the pair instantly quiets down. Up close you can see an anarchist patch on one of their jackets, revealing them to be separatists. “Didn't you help us out earlier?”, the other asks.</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.c1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1>“Yep, that's me.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.c1>“You see all that crew running around? A lot of subs here are readying for a dive.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1>“I wonder where they're going.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Yeah, so do we. We sent one of ours to the office to find out.” The speaker shifts their weight and pauses for a bit. “They haven't come back yet, and I'm getting worried. Might've been caught doing something they shouldn't have.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1>“I could find out.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Not a bad idea. Officials here don't know you yet. Just sneak in, see what you can see. Whatever it is, don't cause a scene.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Wouldn't dream of it.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“Oh, and if our guy ask you if you've had Versas liver, the answer is “It's to die for.””</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“Got it.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>Peeking into a side room, you see somebody sitting on a chair, handcuffed. Judging by their bloody and swollen face, they've been roughed up pretty thoroughly.</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>Check on them.</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>The person is semi-delirious, but they manage to mutter a question: “You ever- ever had V-versas liver?”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>“No, never.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>“S-shame. I hear it's to die for.” They chuckle to themselves. “You better leave before s-security comes back. If you could let somebody know I'm in here, it'd be s-swell.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>You inform the separatists of the location of their agent. They thank you for your help and set out to rescue their comrade.</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>

<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1.c1>You hand the intel to the separatist. “Damn. This isn't much to go on. The only thing this proves is that the Coalition has started mobilizing en masse and they're searching for something. I could've told you that by just looking around. Thanks for your help anyway. If you'll excuse me, we have a rescue mission to undertake.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o1.o2.c1.c1>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o2>“Damn, that sucks. Good luck though.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o1.o1.o2>
<EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o2>“Nope, you must be mistaken.”</EventText.stuckinthemiddle.o1.o2>
<EventText.censorship.c1>“Hey, psst!” You hear a sharp whisper from behind. A person in a clown costume is trying to get your attention.</EventText.censorship.c1>
<EventText.censorship.o1>Listen to what they have to say.</EventText.censorship.o1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.c1>They seem grateful that you're willing to hear them out, but under all that white makeup, you can't be sure. The person is really fidgety and every time they shift, their shoes squeak loudly.</EventText.censorship.o1.c1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.c1>You manage to gather that a shipment of important materials has been falsely impounded from this clown person's vessel and they're asking for help getting it back.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1>Help them out.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1>The jester is overjoyed. The box has been taken to the manager's office. They toot a horn as you turn to leave. Weird.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>There is a box of supplies here, labeled “Confiscated”. This must be what the clown wanted. You bend down and pick up the box, then turn around to head back when you see a security guard pointing at you with a stun baton. “Where do you think you're going? That's confiscated materials you're carrying.”</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.c1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>Be truthful.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>You explain that you're helping someone get their unlawfully confiscated cargo back. “Unlawfully? Do you realize you're carrying highly dangerous implements of terror there?” The guard carefully opens the box, revealing a bunch of red and white costumes and an assortment of bike horns.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.c1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>“I'm sorry, officer. I didn't know.”</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>The guard takes the box from you. “Don't let me catch you trying that shit again.”</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o1.c1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2>Run.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.c1>Without saying another word, you turn tail and run. The officer is stunned for a moment, then chases after you.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o1.o2.c1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2>Lie.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.c1>You explain that you are a new customs officer here and are transporting the box to a more secure facility.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.c1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1>The guard scratches their head.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1>The guard decides it's not worth their time to fact-check what you said. They wave you to continue on.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1.c1>The clown is happy to see their items back and teaches you a customary clown greeting that you can use to impress other clowns.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c1.c1>
<EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c2>The guard is not convinced and takes the box from you.</EventText.censorship.o1.o1.o1.c1.o2.o1.c2>
